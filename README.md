# Network-Reconstruction-via-the-minimum-description-length-principle
This repository contains the work I developed for my Bachelor's thesis, based on Tiago Peixoto’s article Network Reconstruction via the MDL Principle.

The project explores two different approaches to network reconstruction:

L1_reconstruction.ipynb: file dedicated to network reconstruction using L1 regularization.

MDL_UTILITY.ipynb: a custom library containing the functions I developed for MDL-based reconstruction.

MDL_reconstruction.ipynb: the file where MDL_UTILITY is used to test and run the MDL reconstruction procedure.

Tanesini.pdf: is my bachelor thesis, so that anyone can see the context and the theory behind the algorithm.

The purpose of this repository is to collect the code written during my thesis work and to provide an implementation of both the L1-based and MDL-based approaches.

This work is part of my thesis and is inspired by the methodology presented in Peixoto’s paper.

All the algorithms are written in Python in Jupyter Notebook.
