# Network-Reconstruction-via-the-minimum-description-length-principle
This repository contains the work I developed for my Bachelor's thesis, based on Tiago Peixoto’s article Network Reconstruction via the MDL Principle.

The project explores two different approaches to network reconstruction:

NOME1: file dedicated to network reconstruction using L1 regularization.

NOME2: a custom library containing the functions I developed for MDL-based reconstruction.

NOME3: the file where NOME2 is used to test and run the MDL reconstruction procedure.

The purpose of this repository is to collect the code written during my thesis work and to provide a clear structure for the implementation of both the L1-based and MDL-based approaches.

This work is part of my undergraduate thesis and is inspired by the methodology presented in Peixoto’s paper, with a focus on understanding and implementing the reconstruction framework in practice.
